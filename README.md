# E-commerce Entrepreneur Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my E-commerce Entrepreneur Portfolio! In this README file, I'll provide insights into my development process, the challenges faced, and the lessons learned during the creation of my web portfolio.

## Development Process

### Design and Conceptualization

The development process began with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio. I wanted to showcase my skills as an e-commerce entrepreneur and provide visitors with an engaging experience.

### Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.5.2
- JavaScript
- jQuery

I chose this tech stack for its balance of flexibility, responsiveness, and ease of use.

### Responsive Design

Ensuring a seamless experience across devices was a priority. Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes helped achieve a responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Image Optimization and Responsiveness

One challenge was ensuring consistent image heights across different screen sizes. I addressed this by utilizing the `srcset`, `sizes`, and `picture` elements, providing a responsive and optimized image solution.

### Navbar Styling

Achieving a white color for the navbar in tablet and mobile formats required custom styling. I overcame this challenge by using custom CSS to create a `navbar-dark` effect.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Optimization is Key:** I learned the importance of optimizing images and utilizing responsive design techniques to enhance performance.

2. **Custom Styling:** Customizing Bootstrap components with additional CSS allowed for a more personalized and polished appearance.

3. **Continuous Learning:** The web development landscape is constantly evolving. This project reinforced the need for continuous learning and adaptation.
